    <p><strong>There is a sad want of variety amongst evergreen and deciduous shrubs in the average English garden.</strong></p>
  <p>
    Faith is placed in a few shrubs with a reputation for robbing the soil of its goodness and making a monotonous ugly green bank, neither pleasant to look at nor of any protective value. As one who knows shrubs well and the way to group them says, "Even the land-scape gardeners, the men who have the making of gardens—with, of course, notable exceptions—do not seem to know the rich storehouse to draw from."
